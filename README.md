# Hi, Dantesito here! 👋🏻

I'm Dante, aka dantesito or d4rm. 🤠

I'm a systems engineering student from Argentina and a freak about blockchain, Ethereum, cryptography, and computers in general. 🧑‍💻 

Currently, I'm learning about smart contracts, cryptography, cybersecurity, and related topics. In the past, I learned web and mobile development with a focus on front-end technologies like TypeScript, React, React Native, and Next.js. 🪷

## past projects / contributions ↓

- [Proof of X](https://pox.me): Open source web3 protocol focused on internet identity and privacy. I contributed developing the web3 software and mantaining the community. Worked with Next.js, Tailwind and front-end smart contracts integrations.

- [Library digital credential](https://x.com/d4rm_/status/1722034025190023404): Open source digital credential software created for my school’s library, built with Expo, React Native, Go, and MySQL. It was my final project for high school.
