# Hi, Dantesito here! 👋🏻

I'm Dante, aka dantesito or d4rm. 🤠

I'm a systems engineering student from Argentina and a freak about blockchain, Ethereum, cryptography, and computers in general. 🧑‍💻 

Currently I'm learning about smart contracts, cryptography, cybersecurity and related things. In the past I've co-founded Libly.xyz and also contributed in [Proof of X](pox.me) protocol, but now I'm focused in learn. 🤜🤛
