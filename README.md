# Hi, Dantesito here! 👋🏻

<p> I am passionate about computing, interested in cryptography, Ethereum, and distributed systems. Last year, I completed my studies as a secondary programming technician, and this year I am starting my degree in systems engineering at UNICEN. I am focused on learning and growing to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem.
